# Modern Web Development

The Egyptian software development market suffers from a scarcity of expert talent as compared to the international market. In this course we will cover the latest stable software development practice, project architecture, design patterns, and technology, in the field of web development.

This course is aimed at those who intend to pursue a career in software development, or want to create a low cost MVP for a startup. After this course you should be familiar with the current state of the art, capable of making educated decisions about your development stack.

The structure of this course is largely motivated by the notion that novice developer start out adopting frameworks and using libraries without critically thinking about wether this tool is the right fit for the job.## Course Flow
* This course will be composed of 13 sessions
* Each session will have 2 parts, exercise and discussion
	* During exercise you will be solving the course assignment
	* During discussion we will discuss the next assignment
	* All concepts discussed are documented in the assignments
	* I will be explaining concepts that are unclear
* After each session I will be updating the course material based on our progress.
* Assignments are 10% each because I have to grade you on something.
	* Grades are awarded on completion (deemed complete by me).
	* Assignments are graded during sessions.
	* Grades can be partial depending on completion level.
	* Best 10 assignments are considered
	* Preferably read or start solving the assignment before the session.
	* If your are incapable of completing the assignment you can be granted the permission to complete it before the next exercise slot.
* The first session is a discussion only session.
* The last session is an assignment only session.
* We should all eat pizza at the end of the course.
## You will need

* A Laptop with a bash shell (Unix bases OS or Windows 10 with ubuntu terminal)
* A modern browser e.g. latest google chrome
* Internet
