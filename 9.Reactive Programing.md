# Reactive Programing: event streams

## Outline

### Objective

* Understand how to manage a stream of events
* Use this tech to manage our messenger

### Technologies used

* Javascript
* Socket.io
* RX

### Design Patterns

* FRP (Functional Reactive Programing)

### What we will do

* Solve exercises in FRP for managing data
* apply this knowledge to our messenger application

## Pre Session

## Session

Read this [Intro to FRP](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)

Complete [This exercise set](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/)
You will find the repo of the online exercise about [here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/learnrx)

create a react app that with a similar interface and connect it to the server

Start adding the extra functionality at the end of the tutorial in your react app

- Add support for nicknames (assign one randomly)
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- add a sidebar Showing who’s online
- Add private messaging (by selecting the form the users who are in the sidebar)
